# Investment-Insights

Here we will be focusing mainly on **three types of investments**:

**1. Investment in Equities:**

Predicting market movement is still challenging due to various reasons such as high dimensionality, data noise, non stationary. The stock market is influenced by countless variables, including economic indicators, company performance, geopolitical events, investor sentiment, and even natural disasters. 
This high dimensional means there are numerous potential predictors, many of which are noisy or have weak predictive power.
Often Stock prices do not follow a steady or consistent, predictable pattern over time. They result in non-stationarity, meaning their statistical properties (mean, variance, etc.) change over time due to various economic cycles, regulatory changes, and market sentiment shifts.,

**3. Investment in Major Economies:**
**Investment** is not just about Money, Its about "**Time**" as well, particularly if you are working for a Major economies/companies with 5-10% of your entire life time, it better to be worth it.  Insights mainly focused for Expats:

Here are the five major factor's (Scale between 0 to 10), which we can use before making any decision:

1. Salary/Growth Opportunities - It also tells us how country economy is performing,
2. Ease of Obtaining Visa: How many skilled workers/talents does the nation attracts, or how competitive is it.
3. Language: Investing our time to learn new language. And, how easy is it for expats. 
4. Making Friends: How vibrant the culture, welcoming/reserved the people are. It also tells us how easy is to do business.

Each country has its own uniqueness and charmness in its own way. Still, there is a room for growth and opportunity. Score is generated by GPT models, and it logically makes sense to me considering these five factors as an Expat.  
(Score might slighly vary due to training bias in the LLM datasets)
