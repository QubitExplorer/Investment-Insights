Predicting market movement is still challenging due to various reasons such as high dimensionality, data noise, non stationary. The stock market is influenced by countless variables, including economic indicators, company performance, geopolitical events, investor sentiment, and even natural disasters. 
This high dimensional means there are numerous potential predictors, many of which are noisy or have weak predictive power.
Often Stock prices do not follow a steady or consistent, predictable pattern over time. They result in non-stationarity, meaning their statistical properties (mean, variance, etc.) change over time due to various economic cycles, regulatory changes, and market sentiment shifts.,
